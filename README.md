# webrtc-fuzzer-corpora

This repository contains [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info) corpus files useful for WebRTC developers to test their implementations.

The `corpora` folders contains subfolders with corpus files.

Some corpus files are taken from the Chromium project (those into the [webrtc/test/fuzzer/](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/master/test/fuzzers/corpora/) folder), so credits to the Chromium guys.

The `reports` folder contains some relevant fuzzer generated crash and memory leak reports contributed by the community.
